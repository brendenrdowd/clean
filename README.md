# CLEAN
Clean is a mock up/DIY time management and personal accountability app modeled somewhat after Clear. 

## To Do Lists
Clean is designed to run multiple lists under categories or titles. Inside each category is a list. This helps optimize planning and priorities. Work items can be kept seperate from person project items which can be kept seperate from chores, personal appointments, or any other sort of category. 

### Long Term Goals
Clean is being built in MEAN to practice MEAN knowledge, reinforce principals, include token authentication and bcrypt hashing and bootstrap integration. Eventually Angular will be swapped for React with the ultimate goal of migrating to React Native.
